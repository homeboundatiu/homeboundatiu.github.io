The [IDAH@IU team](https://idah.indiana.edu) often gets requests to support archiving projects. This repository provides a starting point, a template for using simple Github Pages, done in partnership with [ImaginX en Movimiento (IXeM)](https://www.instagram.com/ixemcollective/?hl=en) co-founded by Marisa Hicks-Alcaraz, the [Center for Research on Race, Ethnicity and Society](https://crres.indiana.edu), and the [Asian Culture Center](https://asianresource.indiana.edu) at Indiana University Bloomington, and with thanks to Jazma Sutton and the [Remembering Freedom](https://longtownhistory.github.io/) descendant community in Greenville and Longtown, Ohio, for the community-archive project that inspired this template.
