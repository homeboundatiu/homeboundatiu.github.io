shortdesc: "The contorted figure in the room has outgrown her environment. This print reflects how deep discomfort and profound change are inextricably linked in the organic, nonlinear process of growth. I created the composition just a month before my high school graduation in May of 2019, but when I look at this piece, I not only remember my 18-year-old self but I also anticipate future versions of myself as they experience periods of inner transformation."
