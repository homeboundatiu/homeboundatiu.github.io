shortdesc: "In Sisters Always Share, distorted space and color mirror the depicted beauty products that augment one’s reality. Using low-brow media such as colored pencils and highlighter, I investigate the ritual practice of getting ready as a young adult with my sister and the ways in which we manipulate the self. Over the years, getting ourselves ready has evolved from trying to fit in to feeling comfortable in our own skin. The viewer, both voyeur and participant, is invited into this intimate moment.”
