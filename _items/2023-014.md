shortdesc: "This work is for the vulnerable hearts that care “too much.” The hearts that have opened themselves to those who were unworthy. The hearts that gave when there was nothing left to give. The hearts that have been taken and torn, shattered, and stepped on. Growing through trauma to find safety, we bind ourselves to those that make us feel safe and seen while constantly on the lookout for the reemergence of the unworthy takers."
