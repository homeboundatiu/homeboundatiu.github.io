shortdesc: "The contorted figgure in the room has outgrown her environment. This
print reflects how deep discomfort and profound change are
inextricably linked in the organic, nonlinear process of growth. I
created the composition just a month before my high school
graduation in May of 2019, but when I look at this piece, I not only
remember my 18-year-old self but I also anticipate future versions of
myself as they experience periods of inner transformation."
