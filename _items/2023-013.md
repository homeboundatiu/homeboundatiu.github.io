shortdesc: ""Citrus Youth" is a mixed-media piece on a beige acrylic base. The use of negative film strips and orange references allude to the artist's background in film photography and their upbringing in Orange County, California. The piece portrays two oranges, side-by-side, constructed from film negatives. In tune with the gallery theme, the plastic is ingrained with some images the artist defines as "home." The oranges, one whole, and one peeled, represent the contrasting natures of youth and adulthood—specifically, in regards to one's childhood home."
