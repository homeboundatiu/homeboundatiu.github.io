shortdesc: "I painted this watercolor at my mother's house during the 2023 spring break. This piece was based on a series of doodles in my notebook that reflected the introspection of returning to the place I consider home, an event that becomes rarer with the passing years. The painting itself is a study on the plants and colors surrounding the house and the recharging energy of being in the warm tropical space I grew up in."
