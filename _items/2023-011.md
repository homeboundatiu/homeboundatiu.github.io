shortdesc: "This work is an exploration of dementia and the effects it has on the physical surroundings of those around the individual and of the individual suffering. The comfort of specific things that I remember from my childhood home have been altered as a direct result of memory loss and the act of caring for my grandmother. These images are of scenes that I remember fondly from growing up, like her bathroom or her bedside table, that have changed as a result of disease and the construction of this series seeks to explore the fragmentation and loss of memory through visual representation."
