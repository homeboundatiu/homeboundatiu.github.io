shortdesc: "Oftentimes, knowledge of what our ancestor’s lives were like is passed down through cultural objects, and where my ancestors are from, that is passed down through textile patterns. In Scotland, as well as across Eastern Europe in Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Russia, these patterns and fabrics have been passed down through families for at least hundreds of years. I have no idea what their lives were like or who they were as people, but what they created still lives on, and they’re still as beautiful as they must have been back then."
