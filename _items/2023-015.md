shortdesc: "Perseverancia is one of various pieces I did using different mediums—in this case, laser cut wood—and is based on a sketch I did while doing fieldwork in Puerto Rico in 2017. The original piece, drawn with a ballpoint pen in one of my field notebooks on October 1, 2017, was a sketch of a specific pitirre, Puerto Rico's national bird, that sat on the lamppost in front of my in-laws' house after Hurricane Maria. The fierce and small pitirre is known for protecting its home and family, and its presence continues to give me hope of a better tomorrow, and of the home I carry in my heart."
