shortdesc: "Metamorphosis presents the idea of home and belonging in an internalized sense. These pods present various moments-- both past and future-- and define home at a certain point in time and phase of life. They demonstrate a progression of travel and change: from old friends, to a new forever partner, to my temporary place in the IU arts community and more, this soft sculpture reveals where I have belonged and found a home among others in a sometimes abstract or untraditional way."
