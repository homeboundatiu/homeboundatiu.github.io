shortdesc: "Home is a big part of daily life, and this piece is about the ways ordinary things can be fulfilling. I want people to appreciate and enjoy everyday life and all the good moments within it. In this piece, I am paying homage to burning incense after cleaning the house, watching the curtains fluttering in the breeze of an open window, sunlight coming in as a shape on the floor, grass seeds illuminated by the setting sun, and noticing how the pieces stick together while having a bowl of cereal."
