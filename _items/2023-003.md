shortdesc: "Collected memories, experiences and dreams continuously make up the person that I am in this present moment; many of which have transpired in and around the places I’ve lived. In this piece, containing two self-portraits, parts of myself are interacting with one another. With the silhouettes of homes from my past and present in the background, I am grounded by who I was in these places while also guided to fly into who I will become."
